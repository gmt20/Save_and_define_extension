# Save_and_define_extension
I built this extension to help improve my english vocabulary. This is a small chrome extension which can be used to save words from any web page which is stored in chrome Storage API. It can then be used to retrive the definitions of these stored words at any time convenient to the user. The definitions are retrived from this API(https://googledictionaryapi.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/)
