# Save_and_define_extension
While browsing a webpage or a blog, I find many words that should be part of my vocabulary. 
To not break the flow of read, I made this chrome extension that save  the words to a list in chrome storage API. 
Further, at any convenient time, I can use this extension to see the definitions, which it retrieves from this API(https://googledictionaryapi.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/).
